The Break down

The following is the command broken down into sections, each part of the terminal command is configuring the live feed into a video format to send to YouTube or Facebook.

-o - Makes it write the video data from the Pi camera to STDOUT so it gets piped into ffmpeg
-t 0 - Record the video until you manually stop the program
-vf -hf - Flips the image horizontal and vertical so it looks correct
-fps 30 - Sets frames per second to 30
-b 6000000 - output bitrate limit. YouTube recommends 400-600kbps, this is 600kbps.
-re - tells ffmpeg to slow down the reading of the input to the native frame rate of the input
-ar 44100 -ac 2 -acodec pcm_s16le -f s16le -ac 2 -i /dev/zero and -acodec aac -ab 128k and -strict experimental - Adds a dummy audio channel filled with zero data (YouTube rejects streams without an audio channel)
-g 50 - Adds a keyframe every 50 frames.
-f h264 and -f flv tells ffmpeg it's receiving h264 input and that you should mux it into flv output
By not using -w and -h in raspivid you will get the full 1920x1080 HD resolution streamed
